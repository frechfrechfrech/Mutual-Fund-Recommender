## Recommender Model:

### A recommender you know and love: Netflix

    Netflix provides recommendations for movies to its users
    One of the methods it employs is collaborative filtering
    Idea: "People like you like this movie so we think youâ€™ll like it too."
    Steps:
        1. Use ratings/preferences of similar users to predict what ratings you would give movies/tv shows
        2. Recommend the movies/tv shows with the highest predicted ratings


### Mutual Fund Recommender Components

### Collaborative Filtering through Matrix Decomposition

This type of recommender system seeks to predict currently-unknown ratings.
- The matrix of known ratings is decomposed with the objective of minimizing error on **known** ratings. Unknown ratings are ignored.
- The original ratings matrix is then reconstructed and the resulting values for the unknown ratings are the rating predictions.

## WebApp

In order to be useful to mutual fund wholesalers who are pitching products to
financial advisors, this tool needs to be available on-the-go.

To facilitate that, I have created a flask app prototype.

### Results
The recommender returns the top funds currently selling in the office as well
as the top fund recommendations based on collaborative filtering.
